					"Artists for Appalachia" is a grassroots initiative inspired by the heartfelt desire to
					directly support communities affected by the recent natural disaster in North Carolina and
					surrounding areas. We bring together artists willing to give their artwork and individuals
					ready to make a meaningful difference through direct giving. This movement is rooted in
					the principles of generosity and trust, empowering donors to choose how and where their
					contributions make an impact, while artists share their creations to foster healing and
					hope.
