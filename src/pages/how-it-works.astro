				<h1>Artists Unite to Support Appalachia</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Artists Offer Their Artworks</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Artists willing to participate post images of the paintings or artworks they wish to
								give.
							</li>
							<li>They include the general value of each piece to guide potential donors.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Donors Choose and Pledge</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Donors browse the available artworks in the gallery.</li>
							<li>
								Upon selecting a piece, they contact the artist directly to express their interest.
							</li>
							<li>
								The donor agrees to give an amount, typically aligned with the artwork's value.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Direct Giving to the Cause</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Donors make their financial gift directly to the cause(s) of their choice.</li>
							<li>
								This could be a single organization, multiple charities, local churches, or even
								directly to individuals in immediate need.
							</li>
							<li>Donors may also choose to support other artists who need assistance.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Trust-Based Exchange</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The system operates on mutual trust; proof of donation is appreciated but not
								mandatory.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the donation is made, the artist arranges the delivery of the artwork to the
								donor.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>No Intermediaries or Administrative Fees</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>All transactions are between the donor and the recipient(s) of their choice.</li>
							<li>
								The campaign does not handle any funds, ensuring that 100% of the donations reach
								those in need.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Use of Community Platforms</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Facebook: Artists can post their offerings on the "Made for Artists" Facebook page
								using the hashtag #GivingArtsForAppalachia.
							</li>
							<li>
								Website: A dedicated page on the MFA.studio website showcases participating artists
								and their available artworks.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Open Participation</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The initiative is open to all artists, regardless of their platform size or
								following.
							</li>
							<li>
								It encourages a grassroots approach, where every contribution makes a difference.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Emphasis on Giving Over Donations</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The focus is on the act of giving, which allows for more flexibility and avoids
								potential legal issues associated with formal donations.
							</li>
							<li>
								Participants are encouraged to "do their own digging" to find causes that resonate
								with them personally.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
